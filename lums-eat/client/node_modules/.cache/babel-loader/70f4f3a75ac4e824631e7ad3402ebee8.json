Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\n\n\nvar IndexedDbPersistence =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  function IndexedDbPersistence(allowTabSynchronization, persistenceKey, clientId, platform, lruParams, queue, serializer, sequenceNumberSyncer) {\n    this.allowTabSynchronization = allowTabSynchronization;\n    this.persistenceKey = persistenceKey;\n    this.clientId = clientId;\n    this.queue = queue;\n    this.sequenceNumberSyncer = sequenceNumberSyncer;\n    this._started = false;\n    this.isPrimary = false;\n    this.networkEnabled = true;\n    /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\n\n    this.windowUnloadHandler = null;\n    this.inForeground = false;\n    /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\n\n    this.documentVisibilityHandler = null;\n    /** The client metadata refresh task. */\n\n    this.clientMetadataRefresher = null;\n    /** The last time we garbage collected the Remote Document Changelog. */\n\n    this.lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\n    /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\n\n    this.primaryStateListener = function (_) {\n      return Promise.resolve();\n    };\n\n    this.referenceDelegate = new IndexedDbLruDelegate(this, lruParams);\n    this.dbName = persistenceKey + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\n    this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\n    this.document = platform.document;\n    this.queryCache = new IndexedDbQueryCache(this.referenceDelegate, this.serializer);\n    this.indexManager = new IndexedDbIndexManager();\n    this.remoteDocumentCache = new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer, this.indexManager,\n    /*keepDocumentChangeLog=*/\n    this.allowTabSynchronization);\n\n    if (platform.window && platform.window.localStorage) {\n      this.window = platform.window;\n      this.webStorage = this.window.localStorage;\n    } else {\n      throw new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, 'IndexedDB persistence is only available on platforms that support LocalStorage.');\n    }\n  }\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.getStore = function (txn, store) {\n    if (txn instanceof IndexedDbTransaction) {\n      return SimpleDb.getStore(txn.simpleDbTransaction, store);\n    } else {\n      throw fail('IndexedDbPersistence must use instances of IndexedDbTransaction');\n    }\n  };\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.createIndexedDbPersistence = function (options) {\n    return tslib_1.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n      var persistence;\n      return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n        switch (_a.label) {\n          case 0:\n            if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\n              throw new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\n            }\n\n            persistence = new IndexedDbPersistence(options.allowTabSynchronization, options.persistenceKey, options.clientId, options.platform, options.lruParams, options.queue, options.serializer, options.sequenceNumberSyncer);\n            return [4\n            /*yield*/\n            , persistence.start()];\n\n          case 1:\n            _a.sent();\n\n            return [2\n            /*return*/\n            , persistence];\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  /**\r\n   * Attempt to start IndexedDb persistence.\r\n   *\r\n   * @return {Promise<void>} Whether persistence was enabled.\r\n   */\n\n\n  IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\n    assert(this.window !== null, \"Expected 'window' to be defined\");\n    return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, new SchemaConverter(this.serializer)).then(function (db) {\n      _this.simpleDb = db;

This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\r\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(allowTabSynchronization, persistenceKey, clientId, platform, lruParams, queue, serializer, sequenceNumberSyncer) {\r\n        this.allowTabSynchronization = allowTabSynchronization;\r\n        this.persistenceKey = persistenceKey;\r\n        this.clientId = clientId;\r\n        this.queue = queue;\r\n        this.sequenceNumberSyncer = sequenceNumberSyncer;\r\n        this._started = false;\r\n        this.isPrimary = false;\r\n        this.networkEnabled = true;\r\n        /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\r\n        this.windowUnloadHandler = null;\r\n        this.inForeground = false;\r\n        /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\r\n        this.documentVisibilityHandler = null;\r\n        /** The client metadata refresh task. */\r\n        this.clientMetadataRefresher = null;\r\n        /** The last time we garbage collected the Remote Document Changelog. */\r\n        this.lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\r\n        /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\r\n        this.primaryStateListener = function (_) { return Promise.resolve();
